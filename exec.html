                            team. He has greatly enjoyed his time on the team so far, particularly team trips and competing in Collegiate

                            She really cherishes the friendships she has made through this team. Melanie is excited for her first year on the

                            family as a fun and healthy way to get together in the summers. Having swam and ran competitively throughout middle 
                            school and high school she found that she had a solid foundation for the sport and enjoyed the challenge it presented. 
                            Miranda joined the MN Triathlon team mostly looking for a solid group of people to work out with but soon found herself 
                            competing at Collegiate Nationals in Arizona. She has enjoyed pushing herself and becoming friends with a great group 
                            of people along the way. She looks forward to the coming year with the team and improving her race! </p>

                            to train with and keep her committed to working hard in preparation for races.  She has competed with the team at Collegiate
